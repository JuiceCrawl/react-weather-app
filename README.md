# Weather React App
This was my first React app created without guidance. This project is a recreation of [this weather site](http://www.reactjsprogram.com/React-Fundamentals-Project/index.html). An alternate code option can be found [here](https://github.com/ReactjsProgram/ES6-for-React-Curriculum). If you'd like to recreate this app to with more guidance, check out [this page](https://github.com/ReactjsProgram/React-Fundamentals-curriculum). If you are just learning React, I recommend checking out [this course](http://courses.reactjsprogram.com/courses/reactjsfundamentals). 
* Note if you try to run this app you will need add your own API key. The API used can be found [here](http://openweathermap.org/). 

Future versions may involve refactoring, add PropTypes for clarity and impliment Redux. Stay tuned.
